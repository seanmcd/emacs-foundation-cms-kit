I assert copyright over this code, but it has no license.

Since I wrote this code for a particular company in a particular place and
time, and since its usefulness is contingent on having access to that company's
network and servers, this code probably will not be useful to you. There is no
official license to it. The unofficial license is "if you're an employee of
DesertNet, have at it, otherwise please don't use this."

Seriously, even if you're a Foundation CMS license-holder, this probably won't
be useful to you except as a learning exercise in elisp.
